# Error Handling

Rust requires to acknowledge errors. THey can be either recoverable or unrecoverale
  Recoverable - report the problem to the user and retry the operatio. Result <T, E>
  Unrecoverable - symptom of bug -- panic! stops execution

## Unrecoverable
walks back, cleans up and then exits. Use panic = 'abort' in appropriate [profile] in Cargo.toml
